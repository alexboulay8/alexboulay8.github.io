Prompt: Can you help me find C3P0?

Notice in prompt it says to find C3P0
 - C3P0 in Star Wars is a robot

 We need to find the robots
    Google how to find robots on a website?
    It will return "robots.txt meta tag"

    Google where to place meta tag 
    - IN THE URL

Once you put robots.txt at the end of the URL
You get to a page that says "/I_FUOND_HIM.html"

If you place that at the end of the URL instead of "robots.txt"
    It will take you to a page that contains the flag 

Flag = lbctf{f0und_d@_r0b0ts}
